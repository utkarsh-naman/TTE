# TTE (Text To Expression)

This is a convertor that takes normal mathematical text expressions as String inputs (eg. "2+ln2‚àöœÄ) and return the expression as it would be written in python (2+(math.log(2))*(math.sqrt(math.pi))

**To Do So**


    pip install utnamtte



#Method 1

    import utnamtte
    print(utnamtte.tte("2+ln2"))



#Method 2

    from utnamtte import tte
    print(tte("2+ln2"))



#Method 3

    from utnamtte import tte as xy
    print(xy("2+ln2"))
